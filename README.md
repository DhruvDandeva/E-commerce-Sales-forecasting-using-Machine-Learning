E-Commerce Sales Forecasting using Deep Learning

Project Overview:
This project aims to forecast e-commerce sales using deep learning techniques. The system is divided into two main components:  

1. Model Training and Forecasting (Google Colab)
2. Dashboard Visualization (Streamlit in VS Code)

By leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, the project predicts future sales trends based on historical data.
The insights and forecasts are then displayed in an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.

Workflow:

1. Data Processing and Model Training in Google Colab
- The dataset consists of historical sales data for various laptop brands.  
- The data is preprocessed, scaled, and formatted for time-series forecasting.  
- An LSTM-based neural network is trained to predict future sales trends.  
- The trained model is saved and exported for use in the dashboard.  
- Forecasted results and model performance metrics (R square scores) are stored in CSV format.  

2. Interactive Dashboard using Streamlit in VS Code 
- The dashboard loads the precomputed forecasted sales data.  
- It visualizes:  
  - Overall Sales Trends using line charts.  
  - Brand-wise Sales Forecasts using bar charts.  
  - Prediction for Specific Days (1 to 7 days ahead).
